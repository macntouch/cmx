This folder contains all the files required to run a simple simulation
application that demonstrates the client tracking capabilities of CMX.

A few considerations can be made before attempting to run the application.

  1.  The application was designed and tested on a centos/7 vagrant box using
      virtualbox as the provider.
  2.  A setting.txt files is required to successfully run the application. The
      details of the settings file is as follows:
        line 0 -> username of the CMX system used
        line 1 -> password of the CMX system used
        line 2 -> URL of the CMX server used
        line 6 -> URL of the Spark API server
        line 9 -> token for the Spark room ID
        line 10 -> token for the Spark Bot used

The application will run in 2 minute cycles and will check the number of people
in a predefined "Cashier" zone. Once the number of people in this zone passes
a defined threshold a message will be generated by a Spark Bot and sent to a
Cashier group on Spark.

A automated testing environment has been scripted and has been provided in this
folder. The testing environment requires virtualbox and vagrant to be installed
prior to running the configuration script "system_config.sh".

Once run the scripts will automatically download the relevant vagrant box file,
configure the test environment and start the VM.
